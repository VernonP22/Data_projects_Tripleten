# TripleTen_projects
Projects I worked on while attending the Data Analysis TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | Spreadsheet Data Analysis| In this project, data was analyzed to solve a real-world business problem, with the final deliverable being revised based on feedback until it met the required standards. |
| 2 | Zuber - A New Ride-Sharing Company| In this project, SQL skills were applied to analyze taxi ride data for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company in Chicago, to identify patterns in passenger preferences and the impact of external factors like weather. The analysis involved tasks such as comparing ride frequencies across different companies and testing how weather conditions affected ride durations, using various SQL techniques like JOIN and CASE statements. |
| 3 | E-Commerce Company| In this project, I acted as a junior analyst at an e-commerce company analyzing raw transaction logs to build a conversion funnel, prepare data for cohort analysis, and calculate retention rates. The analysis involved filtering and organizing user activity data, calculating first purchase dates, grouping users by cohorts, and calculating monthly retention rates, while ensuring the final spreadsheet was polished and professionally organized for executive review. |
| 4 | Superstore Consultant| In this project, the goal was to analyze the Superstoreâ€™s operations to increase profitability by creating visualizations that identified key profit centers, advertising opportunities, and products with high return rates. The analysis included visualizing profit/loss data, recommending advertising strategies, and examining return rates, followed by submitting the project with visualizations on Tableau Public for review. |
| 5 | Superstore Product Returns | In this project, an analysis was conducted to identify the root causes of high return rates at the Superstore by building various visualizations, such as scatterplots, bar charts, and geographic maps. The findings were compiled into a comprehensive dashboard, which was then presented as a Tableau Story, showcasing key insights, actionable recommendations, and a guide for using the dashboard to monitor and reduce returns. |
| 6 | Shopify App Analysis| In this project, the Shopify app landscape was analyzed using Power BI, focusing on key factors influencing app success such as review count, average ratings, and developer responsiveness. Visualizations like scatterplots, bar charts, and KPI cards were created to examine trends across app categories, review helpfulness, and developer engagement, with detailed insights into how these factors correlate with app performance and customer satisfaction. |
| 7 | Zomato - Restaurant Analysis| The project focuses on analyzing the popularity and profitability of restaurants, exploring factors such as revenue generation, cuisine types, and location. A dashboard presented the top 10 findings which included restaurants, cuisines, popular areas, and revenue generation; with the hypothesis that the most popular restaurants will generate the highest revenue, especially in densely populated areas.|
